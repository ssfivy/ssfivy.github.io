# Hi, I'm Irving.

I like solar car racing and 3D printers.

I am pretty good at conjuring complex incantations in an arcane language, casting it into a spell, then using a magic wand to put it into a piece of silicon that will proceed to being a dead hardware to life.

Basically programming with C, compiling it, then using a JTAG programmer to write it into a chip which will then start working.

(I like Python and Go too!)
